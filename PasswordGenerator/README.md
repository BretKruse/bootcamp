# Password Generator

## Description

- I wanted to create a generator that would create a unique password automatically.
- To advance my skill in JavaScript and create a project that could be used in the future.
- Creates a unique password that would not easily be guessed and keeps a user safe.
- Learned to make multiple loops and give a user options for the password using the prompt and confirm functions. Learning more on joining strings together using certain coding.

## Usage

You will click the red generate password button in the middle of the screen.
There will be four messages asking if you will like uppercase letters, lowercase, special character, or numbers.
You will click ok on characters you will like to have in your password or click cancel to the characters you don't wish to have.
Then you will get a prompt asking you how long you will like the password to be. You must choose between 8 and 128.
A password will be generated for you after this is complete.
